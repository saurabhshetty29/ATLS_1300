    OBJECTIVE - To get one of the bugs to leave the water by getting the turtles to 
    chase the bugs. When this occurs, "You win!" is printed in the command line.
    
    RULES - To win, the player has to click on the bugs repeatedly until their 
    random movement eventually results in one of the bugs leaving the water. 
    This appears as if the turtles are chasing the bugs.

    CHALLENGE - The player has to get one of the bugs out of the water.
    
    INTERACTIONS - The player is clicking to direct the turtle to the bug.
